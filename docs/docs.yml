      summary: Predict a student's success by ID.
      description: >
        Using a ML model based on the parameters `studytime`, `failures`,
        `absences`, `G1`, and `G2`, predict the quality of the student,
        specifically `G3`. A student predicted to have a `G3` grade of 15 or
        higher is high-quality.

        Train the ML model over a historical dataset (/data/student-mat.csv) of
        student performance. Our ML model uses 5 inputs from the dataset: 
        `studytime`, `failures`, `absences`, `G1`, and `G2`. The target 
        performance metric of our model is `G3`. The data is in JSON format.

        Before training our ML model on a dataset, we should clean the data.
        Remove corrupt, incorrect, or unnecessary data from the dataset
